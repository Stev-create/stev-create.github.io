<h2>Hi there, I'm Stev ðŸ‘‹</h2>

Well, I see myself as a problem solver, Data Scientist and Data Analyst who  love  to  help  companies  make  sense  of  their  data  and  turn their  data  into  actionable  insight, through  Data  Science  and Machine Learning. 

I love programming in Python and in my spare time, I write stories (in Indonesian) about Python, Data Science, and Statistics in Medium. [You can Check here](https://medium.com/@stevkarta)
